							<h3>Pushing past the first rejection</h3>
							<p>I was rejected by Harvard and Yale. This may sound common, but
							my rejection came a different place than the admission board.
							Both Harvard and Yale told me they wanted me to come play football for
							them, and I was ready to go. However,
							each team decided to back out of their interest shortly before
							I was able to officialy be a part of the team.
							<br> <img src=images/harvard.jpg alt="" width=200px; height=300px;>
							<br> Not only did this hurt my idea of playing football after high school,
							but it also took a shot to my ego (thank God). I was beginning to like
							the image of being an "Ivy League football player", and definitely took pride in that.
							This experience helped me turn to God and trust in His plans
							over my own. Humility came to me when I did not want it, but I
							am grateful it did.

							<h3>Young and Arrogant</h3>

								Senior year of high school. Volleyball game right before
								halloween. It was costume themed and so I had my
			<a href=https://horrorfreaknews.com/new-director-chosen-purge-4/19052/ >purge</a>
								setup in full swing. I was told multiple times to
								take the mask off for safety reasons, and 17 year old me
								did not find that a valid reason. I chose to "stand my ground"
								and leave the game with the mask still on.<br>
								I was suspended 3 days, and lost my role as "pep rally leader".
								<br><p><img src="images/maskk.gif" alt="" width=500px;

							<p>I looked back and realized how dumb it was, and the penalty
							was definitely not worth the action. I was humbled for sure,
						and made sure I would not do something so stupid again.
					Respect for authority became more of a priority in my life.</p>
